/* Key Concepts:
ID Selectors (#): Targets specific elements with a given ID.
Class Selectors (.): Applies styles to elements with specified class names.
Element Selectors: Targets all instances of a particular HTML element.
Inheritance and Specificity: More specific rules (like the ol>li rule) override more general rules, and later rules can overwrite earlier ones (as seen with the div color change). */
