    <h2>hello mai to app.html yelo tumahara paani</h2>
    <!-- <h2> is a level 2 heading used to display text. 
         It represents a subtitle or a less important heading than <h1>. 
         In this case, it's saying "hello, I'm app.html, here is your water," which seems like a humorous reference to something possibly from another file. -->
