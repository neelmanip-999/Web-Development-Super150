Understanding Promises in JavaScript

A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. It provides a way to handle asynchronous tasks like fetching data from an API, reading files, or performing time-consuming calculations without blocking the main thread.

Key Characteristics of a Promise:
1. Promise is created using the `new Promise()` constructor.
2. It takes a callback function as an argument, which itself has two parameters: `resolve` and `reject`.
   - `resolve(value)` is used when the operation is successful.
   - `reject(error)` is used when the operation fails.
3. It can have three states:
   - Pending ‚Üí Initial state, before success or failure.
   - Fulfilled (Resolved) ‚Üí When `resolve()` is called.
   - Rejected ‚Üí When `reject()` is called.
4. We handle results using `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `.finally()` methods.
   - `.then(callback)` ‚Üí Runs if promise is resolved successfully.
   - `.catch(callback)` ‚Üí Runs if promise is rejected.
   - `.finally(callback)` ‚Üí Runs in every case (whether resolved or rejected).

Example with Detailed Explanation:
```javascript
// Creating a Promise object
let p1 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    // Simulating some work being done (like fetching data from a server)
    let isSuccess = true;  // Change this to false to simulate rejection

    if (isSuccess) {
        resolve("Success: You received 100 rupees!");
    } else {
        reject("Error: Transaction failed!");
    }
});

// Handling the resolved or rejected state using .then, .catch, and .finally
p1.then(function(data) {
    console.log("‚úÖ Promise resolved with data:", data);
}).catch(function(error) {
    console.log("‚ùå Promise rejected with error:", error);
}).finally(function() {
    console.log("üîÑ This will run regardless of success or failure.");
});
```

Step-by-Step Breakdown of Code:

Step 1: Creating a Promise
```javascript
let p1 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
```
- We create a new Promise instance using the `new Promise()` constructor.
- The constructor takes a function (executor function) with `resolve` and `reject` as parameters.

Step 2: Handling Conditions inside the Promise
```javascript
    let isSuccess = true; // Change this to false to simulate rejection
```
- We simulate a scenario where the operation can either succeed or fail.
- Setting `isSuccess = true` will resolve the promise, while `false` will reject it.

Step 3: Resolving or Rejecting the Promise
```javascript
    if (isSuccess) {
        resolve("Success: You received 100 rupees!");
    } else {
        reject("Error: Transaction failed!");
    }
```
- If `isSuccess` is `true`, we call `resolve("Success: You received 100 rupees!")`.
- If `isSuccess` is `false`, we call `reject("Error: Transaction failed!")`.

Step 4: Handling the Promise with `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `.finally()`

Handling Success with `.then()`
```javascript
p1.then(function(data) {
    console.log("‚úÖ Promise resolved with data:", data);
```
- `.then(callback)` runs when the promise is **resolved**.
- The `data` parameter receives the resolved value (`"Success: You received 100 rupees!"`).

Handling Errors with `.catch()`
```javascript
}).catch(function(error) {
    console.log("‚ùå Promise rejected with error:", error);
```
- `.catch(callback)` runs when the promise is **rejected**.
- The `error` parameter receives the rejected value (`"Error: Transaction failed!"`).

Ensuring Cleanup with `.finally()`
```javascript
}).finally(function() {
    console.log("üîÑ This will run regardless of success or failure.");
});
```
- `.finally(callback)` always runs **whether the promise resolves or rejects**.
- Useful for cleanup tasks, such as hiding a loading spinner.

Testing Different Scenarios

Case 1: Promise Resolves Successfully
If `isSuccess = true`, the output will be:
```
‚úÖ Promise resolved with data: Success: You received 100 rupees!
üîÑ This will run regardless of success or failure.
```

Case 2: Promise is Rejected
If `isSuccess = false`, the output will be:
```
‚ùå Promise rejected with error: Error: Transaction failed!
üîÑ This will run regardless of success or failure.
```

Conclusion
- Promises help manage asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
- The `resolve()` function handles successful operations.
- The `reject()` function handles failures.
- `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `.finally()` provide structured ways to handle promise results.
- Promises are essential for working with APIs, file handling, and real-time data processing.
