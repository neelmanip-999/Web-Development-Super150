# Socket.IO

* **Socket.IO** is a **JavaScript library** that enables **real-time communication** between clients (like browsers, mobile apps) and servers.
* It is built on top of the **WebSocket protocol**, but it is not limited to WebSockets. Socket.IO provides additional features like **automatic reconnection, event-based communication, broadcasting, rooms, namespaces, and fallbacks** (such as long-polling if WebSockets are not available).

---

## What is WebSocket?

WebSocket is a **protocol**, similar to `http://` or `https://`, but with its own scheme:

* `ws://` → non-secure WebSocket
* `wss://` → secure WebSocket (like HTTPS)

Unlike HTTP, which follows a **request-response model** where only the client can initiate communication, WebSockets allow **full-duplex communication** — meaning **both client and server can send messages to each other at any time** once a connection is established.

---

## Features of Sockets

1. **Real-time communication** → Information is exchanged immediately without delays.
2. **Instantaneous** → Data is pushed instantly to connected clients.
3. **Low latency** → Minimal delay because no repeated handshakes are required after the initial connection.
4. **Bidirectional** → Both client and server can initiate communication.
5. **Event-driven** → Communication is handled through events. For example, when a button is clicked, an event is emitted to the server, and the server can respond by emitting another event.

---

## Traditional Protocols (HTTP/HTTPS)

* In traditional HTTP communication, the **client always initiates the request**, and the **server only responds**.
* The server cannot send unsolicited data to the client — it must wait until the client asks for something.
* Each time the client sends a request, it passes through multiple layers (like TCP handshake, security checks, and load balancing).
* Because of **load balancing**, the request might not always reach the same server — meaning no persistent connection is maintained.
* As a result, this process adds **latency** since every request is independent and requires re-establishing connections.

---

## How Socket Communication Works

Imagine **User1** wants to send data to **User2**:

1. User1 establishes a connection with a **communication server**.
2. That server already maintains an open connection with User2.
3. When User1 sends data, the server immediately forwards it to User2 through the existing connection.

This creates **two-way, persistent, bidirectional communication**.

### Key points:

* The initial connection may take a little time, but once established, it remains open.
* The server stays fixed for that session (or sticky session setup in production), so communication is very fast.
* Because of this persistent connection, the system achieves **real-time, low-latency performance**.

---

## Express and Socket.IO

* **Express** is built on top of **HTTP protocol**. It is excellent for routing (handling requests and responses in a structured way).
* However, Express by itself **cannot establish WebSocket connections**.
* To enable WebSockets, we create an **HTTP server** and then **wrap it with Socket.IO** to support real-time communication.

So the setup looks like this:

```
Express → handles routing (API, pages, etc.)
HTTP Server → base server
Socket.IO → adds real-time communication on top of the HTTP server
```

---

## Socket.IO Architecture

Socket.IO is composed of **two parts**:

1. **Server-side library** → runs on Node.js, listens for incoming connections, manages rooms, namespaces, and broadcasting.
2. **Client-side library** → runs in the browser (or mobile app), establishes and maintains the connection with the server.

Both sides work together to maintain a **persistent event-driven connection**.

---

## Installation

To use Socket.IO in a project, install it using npm:

```
npm install socket.io
```

* This installs the server-side library for Node.js.
* On the client side (browser), the library can either be installed with `npm install socket.io-client` or loaded via CDN.

---

## Why Socket.IO is More Powerful than Plain WebSocket

* **WebSocket alone**: only provides raw, bidirectional communication. Developers must build reconnection, fallback, and event systems manually.
* **Socket.IO adds**:

  * Automatic reconnection if a client disconnects.
  * Fallbacks (e.g., long polling) when WebSockets are not supported.
  * Event-based messaging (`emit`, `on`).
  * Namespaces (`/chat`, `/admin`) to separate concerns.
  * Rooms (grouping sockets for broadcasting).
  * Middleware for authentication and validation.

---

## Summary

* **HTTP**: request–response model, client always initiates. No persistent connection.
* **WebSocket**: protocol that enables full-duplex, persistent communication.
* **Socket.IO**: a library built on top of WebSocket (and fallbacks), providing real-time, event-driven communication with many advanced features.
* **Express + Socket.IO**: Express handles routes, Socket.IO handles real-time communication over the same HTTP server.

---

✨ In short:
HTTP is like **asking and answering** each time, while WebSocket/Socket.IO is like **keeping a phone call open** where both parties can talk freely whenever they want.

## Clarifications & quick fixes

* **WebSocket vs URLs:** WebSocket is a protocol with its own URL schemes: `ws://` (cleartext) and `wss://` (TLS). It’s not the same as `http://`/`https://`, though the initial upgrade starts over HTTP.
* **Socket.IO ≠ just WebSocket:** Socket.IO is a higher-level real-time engine. It **uses WebSocket when possible** but can **fall back to HTTP long-polling**. It adds reconnection, heartbeats, rooms, namespaces, acks, etc.
* **“HTTP is one-way”** — not exactly. HTTP is **request/response** (client-initiated). Servers can’t push arbitrarily over plain HTTP/1.1 without extra techniques. WebSocket/Socket.IO allow true **full-duplex** push.
* **“Server will be fixed”** — in production behind load balancers, a client must use **sticky sessions** (session affinity) so that the same socket stays on the same node. Otherwise, use a **shared adapter** (e.g., Redis) so events can fan out across nodes.
* **Express + Socket.IO:** You **can** use Express with Socket.IO. Typical pattern: create an **HTTP server** from your Express app and **attach** Socket.IO to that server.

## Deep dive: WebSocket, Engine.IO, and Socket.IO

* **WebSocket (protocol):** Upgrades a single TCP connection to full-duplex. Low overhead after the handshake, great for chat, multiplayer, dashboards.
* **Engine.IO (transport layer used by Socket.IO):** Handles **transport negotiation** (polling → upgrade to WebSocket), heartbeats, and reconnection.
* **Socket.IO (API layer):** Adds **event-based messaging**, **namespaces** (`/admin`, `/chat`), **rooms** (join/leave groups), **broadcasting**, **acknowledgements**, **binary**, **middleware**, and **auto-reconnect**.

### Connection lifecycle (Socket.IO)

1. **Handshake over HTTP** (can start as long-polling).
2. **Transport upgrade** to WebSocket when available.
3. **Heartbeats** (ping/pong) to keep the connection healthy.
4. **Auto-reconnect** with backoff if the network blips.

---

## Key features (beyond “real-time & low-latency”)

* **Event-based API:** `socket.emit('event', data)` / `socket.on('event', handler)`.
* **Acknowledgements:** `socket.emit('save', payload, (ack) => { ... })` to confirm delivery.
* **Rooms:** Group sockets and broadcast: `io.to('room42').emit('msg', ...)`.
* **Namespaces:** Logical separation: `io.of('/admin')`, permissions per space.
* **Broadcasting:** `socket.broadcast.emit(...)` to everyone except sender.
* **Reconnection & backoff:** Built in.
* **Middleware:** Authn/authz at connection or per-packet.
* **Scaling:** Redis adapter to broadcast across many server instances.

---

## How it fits with Express

You’ll typically:

1. Build routes with **Express** (REST, pages, static assets).
2. Create an **HTTP server** from the Express app.
3. Attach **Socket.IO** to that HTTP server.
4. Optionally serve the `socket.io` client from the same origin.

### Minimal example (Node + Express + Socket.IO)

**Server (`server.js`)**

```js
import express from 'express';
import http from 'http';
import { Server } from 'socket.io';

const app = express();
app.get('/health', (_req, res) => res.send('ok'));

const server = http.createServer(app);
const io = new Server(server, {
  cors: { origin: 'http://localhost:5173', methods: ['GET','POST'] }
});

io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  console.log('connected:', socket.id);

  socket.on('chat:message', (msg, ack) => {
    // broadcast to everyone except sender
    socket.broadcast.emit('chat:message', { from: socket.id, text: msg });
    if (ack) ack({ ok: true, at: Date.now() }); // acknowledgement
  });

  socket.on('join-room', (room) => {
    socket.join(room);
    io.to(room).emit('system', `${socket.id} joined ${room}`);
  });

  socket.on('disconnect', (reason) => {
    console.log('disconnected:', socket.id, reason);
  });
});

server.listen(3000, () => console.log('http://localhost:3000'));
```

**Client (vanilla HTML)**

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <body>
    <input id="msg" placeholder="type..." />
    <button onclick="send()">Send</button>

    <script src="https://cdn.socket.io/4.7.5/socket.io.min.js"></script>
    <script>
      const socket = io('http://localhost:3000', {
        transports: ['websocket', 'polling'], // allow fallback
        auth: { token: 'optional-jwt' }
      });

      socket.on('connect', () => console.log('connected', socket.id));
      socket.on('chat:message', (data) => console.log('incoming:', data));
      socket.on('system', (m) => console.log('system:', m));
      socket.on('disconnect', (r) => console.log('disconnected:', r));

      function send() {
        const text = document.getElementById('msg').value;
        socket.emit('chat:message', text, (ack) => console.log('ack:', ack));
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

**Install**

```bash
npm i express socket.io
# (client only) npm i socket.io-client
```

---

## Scaling across multiple servers

* **Sticky sessions:** Configure your load balancer (Nginx/ELB/Ingress) so a socket stays on the **same** node after it connects.
* **Shared adapter:** Use Redis so broadcasts reach all nodes:

```js
import { createAdapter } from '@socket.io/redis-adapter';
import { createClient } from 'redis';

const pub = createClient({ url: 'redis://localhost:6379' });
const sub = pub.duplicate();
await Promise.all([pub.connect(), sub.connect()]);
io.adapter(createAdapter(pub, sub));
```

---

## Security essentials

* **TLS (wss\://)** in production.
* **Origin/CORS restrictions:** set `cors.origin` explicitly.
* **Auth middleware:** verify tokens before allowing connection:

  ```js
  io.use((socket, next) => {
    const token = socket.handshake.auth?.token;
    // verify token; set socket.user = ...
    return token ? next() : next(new Error('unauthorized'));
  });
  ```
* **Rate limit & size limits:** to prevent abuse.
* **Validate payloads:** never trust client data.

---

## When to use Socket.IO (vs raw WebSocket)

* Use **Socket.IO** when you want batteries included: reconnection, rooms/namespaces, acks, fallbacks, and a friendly event API.
* Use **raw WebSocket** (or `ws`, `uWebSockets.js`) if you need minimal overhead and you’re OK building reconnection/broadcast/auth yourself.

---

## Common pitfalls

* **No sticky sessions:** clients “randomly” miss messages after scaling.
* **Proxy misconfig:** make sure to pass upgrade headers (`Connection: upgrade`, `Upgrade: websocket`) through Nginx/Ingress.
* **Mixing `app.listen` with `http.createServer`:** always create the HTTP server and pass it to both Express (via `server`) and Socket.IO.
* **CORS blocked:** set correct `origin` in the server options.

---

## TL;DR

* WebSocket is the **protocol** (`ws://`, `wss://`).
* Socket.IO is a **framework on top** of WebSocket (with fallbacks) that gives you events, rooms, acks, reconnection, etc.
* Use Express for routes, **attach Socket.IO** to the same HTTP server for real-time features.
* For production: **TLS + CORS + auth + sticky sessions + Redis adapter**.
