### 🔌 What is a **Socket** in Networking (especially in programming)?

A **socket** is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on a network. It acts like a virtual plug that lets your program send or receive data over the network.

* In **network programming**, sockets allow communication between:

  * **Client ↔ Server**
  * **Two devices** on the same or different machines
  * **Processes** on the same or different hosts

### 🧠 Why is Socket Used?

Sockets are used for:

* **Real-time communication** (e.g., chat apps, video calls)
* **Client-server communication** (e.g., web browsers & web servers)
* **File transfer protocols** (e.g., FTP)
* **IoT communication**
* **Gaming servers**, etc.

### 📚 Types of Sockets

1. **Stream Sockets (TCP)** – Reliable, connection-based (e.g., HTTP, FTP)
2. **Datagram Sockets (UDP)** – Unreliable, connectionless (e.g., DNS, VoIP)

### 🔧 Syntax and Example in Python

#### 📥 Importing Socket Library

```python
import socket
```

---

### 🖥 Server-Side Socket (TCP Example)

```python
import socket

# Step 1: Create socket object
server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# Step 2: Bind to an IP address and port
server_socket.bind(('localhost', 12345))

# Step 3: Listen for incoming connections
server_socket.listen(5)
print("Server is listening...")

# Step 4: Accept a connection
client_socket, address = server_socket.accept()
print(f"Connection from {address} has been established.")

# Step 5: Receive and send data
data = client_socket.recv(1024).decode()
print("Received from client:", data)

client_socket.send("Hello from server!".encode())

# Step 6: Close the socket
client_socket.close()
server_socket.close()
```

---

### 📱 Client-Side Socket (TCP Example)

```python
import socket

# Step 1: Create socket object
client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# Step 2: Connect to server
client_socket.connect(('localhost', 12345))

# Step 3: Send and receive data
client_socket.send("Hello from client!".encode())
response = client_socket.recv(1024).decode()
print("Received from server:", response)

# Step 4: Close the socket
client_socket.close()
```

### 🧠 Terminology

| Term          | Meaning                                |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `AF_INET`     | Address family for IPv4                |
| `SOCK_STREAM` | Type for TCP                           |
| `SOCK_DGRAM`  | Type for UDP                           |
| `localhost`   | Refers to the same machine             |
| `port`        | Logical connection point (like a door) |

### 🔐 Socket Security Note

* Always validate input and handle exceptions.
* In real-world apps, use **SSL sockets** for encrypted communication.

Key points:
1. Overview of Socket.IO:
Socket.IO is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional, event-based communication between web clients and servers.
It consists of two main parts:
A server-side library (socket.io) that runs on Node.js.
A client-side library that loads in the browser.
2. Components involved:
Server: Implements an HTTP server and integrates with Socket.IO (socket.io).
Client: Loads the Socket.IO client library (socket.io) from a CDN or local files to connect to the server.
During Development:
The command npm install socket.io is used to install the Socket.IO library in the project directory.
Code snippets:
The code shows an example of setting up a simple Socket.IO server using Node.js and Express.js:
javascript
const express = require('express');        // Import Express framework
const app = express();                      // Create an Express application
const http = require('http').createServer(app); // Create an HTTP server

const socketio = require('socket.io');       // Import Socket.IO library
const io = socketio(http);                     // Attach Socket.IO to the HTTP server

// Serve a basic HTML file when client connects
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(__dirname + '/index.html');
});

// When a client connects
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  console.log('a user connected');
});
This code performs the following:
Sets up a basic Express server.
Creates an HTTP server.
Attaches Socket.IO to it.
Serves an index.html file at the root route.
Listens for new client connections (connection event) and logs a message upon connection.
Summary:
This document explains the setup of a real-time server with Socket.IO:

Install the library with npm install socket.io.
Require and initialize the server.
Serve a webpage that connects to the server.
Handle client connections with events like 'connection'.
