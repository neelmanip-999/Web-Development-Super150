JQuery is a library of Js it is used for DOM manipulation.
JQuery.com --> official documentation
# in 2021 it is most loved js library.

we used compressed version --> removing indentation and spacing.
we write the jquery code compressed version in our project.

$ -> it allow variable access by which hum pura dom manipulate kar sakte hn.

$, jQuery is same -> return a function f(e, t);

js is a programming language it have multiple libraries jquery and reactjs is some of them and nextjs is a framework of react.

let a = 10;
a = "neelmani"
it is error suppose we are doing numeric operation then a changes it type that is then show error.
so to overcome this typeScript comes in the market.

$ is similar to queryselectorall of DOM.

jquery does not allow us to use id for more than one attribute.

the property of css that is created at last have more weightage.

.text() --> act as both getter and setter.
