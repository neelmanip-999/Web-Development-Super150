Explanation of Features:
Hover Animation:

When you hover over the .box, the height and background color change.
The animation runs twice (animation-iteration-count: 2).
Keyframes (increaseHeight):

0% (start): The box starts with height: 100px and background-color: cadetblue.
50% (midpoint): The box expands to height: 900px and turns green.
100% (end): The box shrinks to height: 500px and turns red.
Animation Properties:

animation-timing-function: ease-out; → Slows down towards the end.
animation-fill-mode: backwards; → Applies styles from before animation starts.
animation-play-state: running; → Ensures the animation runs when hovered.
How to Experiment:
Try Different animation-direction Options:

normal (default): Runs forward only.
reverse: Runs from end to start.
alternate: Runs forward, then backward.
alternate-reverse: Runs backward, then forward.
Change animation-fill-mode:

forwards: Retains final animation state after completion.
backwards: Applies initial state before animation starts. -->
