<!-- 
Explanation:
HTML Structure:

A parent container <div class="parent"> wraps two child <div> elements (.box and .box2), both of which will have the same style and animation effect.
CSS Styling:

Both .box and .box2 have:
Fixed dimensions (100px by 100px).
Colorful borders on all sides.
Rounded corners using border-radius: 50% to make them circular.
Center alignment with margin: 10px auto.
Hover Effect:

When the user hovers over .box or .box2, two animations are triggered:
loader animation: This animation moves the box vertically (up and down) while rotating it 360 degrees.
backgroundChanger animation: This changes the background color of the box through three different colors.
Keyframes:

loader: Defines how the box should move vertically (translateY) and rotate (rotate).
backgroundChanger: Changes the background color of the box in stages: starting with a yellow color, switching to green, and then changing to red.
Suggestions:
Fixing the Parent Container: The opening tag for the parent container (<div class="parent">) has an extra { at the beginning, which is a syntax error. You should remove it:

Copy
Edit
<div class="parent">
Optional Improvements:

You can adjust the size of the boxes or the duration of the animations based on your preference.
To make it more dynamic, you could add a delay to one of the animations for a more staggered effect. -->
