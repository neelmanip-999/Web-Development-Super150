CSS Media Queries, CSS Box Model, and CSS Flexbox – Detailed Explanation
1. CSS Media Queries
What are Media Queries?
CSS media queries allow developers to apply different styles depending on the device's screen size, resolution, or other properties. They make a website responsive, ensuring it looks good on various devices like desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

How Do Media Queries Work?
Media queries use the @media rule to define breakpoints. When a condition in the query is met (like screen width being less than 600px), different styles are applied.

Common Features Used in Media Queries
Width & Height

max-width: Applies styles if the screen width is less than or equal to a specified value.
min-width: Applies styles if the screen width is greater than or equal to a specified value.
Example:
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) { } → Styles apply when the screen width is 600px or less.
Device Orientation

orientation: landscape: Styles apply when the device is in landscape mode (wider than tall).
orientation: portrait: Styles apply when the device is in portrait mode (taller than wide).
Resolution-Based Queries

min-resolution: Targets screens with higher resolutions (useful for retina displays).
@media screen and (min-resolution: 300dpi) { } → Styles apply to high-resolution screens.
Combining Multiple Conditions

You can combine multiple conditions using and or separate queries using , (comma acts as OR).
Example:
@media screen and (max-width: 800px) and (orientation: portrait) { }
@media screen and (max-width: 600px), (min-width: 1000px) { }
Why Use Media Queries?
Make websites mobile-friendly (responsive design).
Customize styles based on screen size.
Improve user experience on different devices.
2. CSS Box Model
What is the CSS Box Model?
The CSS Box Model describes how elements are structured and how they take up space in a web page. Every element in CSS is considered as a rectangular box, which consists of four layers:

Layers of the Box Model
Content

The actual text or image inside the element.
It takes up the inner space of the box.
Padding

Space between the content and the border.
Increases the distance between content and border without affecting the total width.
Border

A line surrounding the padding and content.
Can be styled (solid, dashed, etc.), changed in thickness, and colored.
Margin

Space outside the border, separating the element from others.
Affects positioning and spacing between elements.
Example Breakdown of Box Model Calculation
If an element has:

width: 200px
padding: 20px
border: 5px
margin: 10px
The total space occupied by the element is:

Width Calculation:
Total width = content width + padding (left + right) + border (left + right)
= 200px + (20px + 20px) + (5px + 5px) = 250px

Height works the same way as width.

Types of Box Sizing
box-sizing: content-box (default)

Width and height include only the content.
Padding and border are not included in the total width.
box-sizing: border-box

Width and height include content, padding, and border.
Prevents layout shifting when padding or border is added.
Why is the Box Model Important?
Helps in understanding element sizing and layout behavior.
Controls spacing and positioning in web design.
box-sizing: border-box is widely used to make layouts easier to manage.
3. CSS Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout)
What is Flexbox?
CSS Flexbox is a layout system that allows easy alignment and distribution of elements inside a container. It is one-dimensional, meaning it works either horizontally (row) or vertically (column) but not both simultaneously.

Key Concepts of Flexbox
Flex Container & Flex Items

The parent element is the flex container.
The child elements inside it are flex items.
display: flex; is used to enable Flexbox on a container.
Main Axis & Cross Axis

The main axis runs horizontally (row) by default.
The cross axis runs vertically (column).
Flex Properties for the Container

flex-direction: Defines the direction of the main axis.

row (default) → Left to right
row-reverse → Right to left
column → Top to bottom
column-reverse → Bottom to top
justify-content: Aligns items along the main axis.

flex-start → Aligns items to the start
flex-end → Aligns items to the end
center → Centers items
space-between → Equal space between items
space-around → Space around items
align-items: Aligns items along the cross axis.

flex-start, flex-end, center, stretch, baseline
flex-wrap: Controls whether items wrap to the next line.

nowrap (default) → All items stay in one line
wrap → Items move to the next line if needed
align-content: Similar to align-items but applies when there are multiple rows.

Flex Properties for Items

flex-grow: Defines how much an item should grow compared to others.
flex-shrink: Defines how much an item should shrink.
flex-basis: Sets the initial size of an item.
order: Controls item placement (lower values appear first).
align-self: Overrides align-items for a specific item.
Why Use Flexbox?
Simplifies complex layouts without using floats or positioning.
Responsive by default – elements automatically adjust.
Great for aligning and distributing items dynamically.
