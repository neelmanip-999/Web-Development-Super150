Floating Images (float property)
float: left; → Moves the image to the left of the container, allowing text to wrap around it.
float: right; → Moves the image to the right, making text flow around it on the left.
Images with float do not affect the normal document flow, so text wraps around them.
Clearing the Float (clear property)
clear: left; → Prevents an element from appearing next to left-floated elements.
clear: right; → Prevents an element from appearing next to right-floated elements.
clear: both; → Prevents an element from appearing next to any floated elements (left or right).
Behavior in the Code
.img1 (first image) is floated left.
.img2 (second image) is floated right.
p:nth-of-type(2), p:nth-of-type(3) { clear: both; }
→ Ensures that these paragraphs appear below both floated images, preventing text wrapping.
