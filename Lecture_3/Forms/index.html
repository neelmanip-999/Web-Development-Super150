    <h1>Forms</h1>

    <!-- Start of the form -->
    <form action="#" method="POST"> 
        <!-- The form element defines the form. action specifies where to send the form data when submitted (currently set to "#" to prevent redirection). method specifies how to send the data; POST sends data through the request body, 
        which is more secure for sensitive information like passwords. -->
        <!-- Label for the name input -->
        <label for="naam">Name: </label>
        <!-- Input field for the user's name -->
        <input type="text" name="name" id="naam"> 
        <!-- This input is for the user's name. -->
        <br>

        <!-- Label for the password input -->
        <label for="pass">Password: </label>
        <!-- Input field for the user's password; the input type is 'password' to hide the text -->
        <input type="password" name="password" id="pass"> 
        <!-- This input is for the user's password. 
        The type "password" obscures the characters entered. -->
        <br>

        <!-- Button to submit the form -->
        <button>Login</button> 
        <!-- This button submits the form when clicked. -->
    </form>

<!-- 1. GET
Description: The GET method appends form data to the URL in the form of a query string. It is commonly used for retrieving data.
Characteristics:
Data is sent in the URL, making it visible to the user.
Limited amount of data can be sent (about 2048 characters).
Suitable for non-sensitive data and requests that do not change server state (e.g., search queries).
Data can be bookmarked and cached since it's part of the URL.

2. POST
Description: The POST method sends data in the body of the request, which is not visible in the URL. It is commonly used for sending sensitive data or modifying server state.

Characteristics:

Data is not visible in the URL.
Can send large amounts of data (the limit depends on server settings).
Suitable for sensitive data like passwords or files.
Data cannot be bookmarked or cached.

3. Other Methods
While GET and POST are the most commonly used methods, HTML5 introduced some additional HTTP methods that can be used in forms, although browser support may vary:

PUT: Used to update existing resources. It sends data in the request body like POST.

DELETE: Used to delete resources. It also sends data in the request body, although the specifics can depend on the API being used.

PATCH: Used to apply partial modifications to a resource.

OPTIONS: Used to describe the communication options for the target resource.

HEAD: Similar to GET, but it retrieves the headers only without the body.

Summary
GET: Data is appended to the URL; best for non-sensitive data retrieval.
POST: Data is sent in the request body; best for sensitive data and resource modification.
PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, HEAD: Additional methods used primarily in RESTful APIs, each with its specific use cases. -->
