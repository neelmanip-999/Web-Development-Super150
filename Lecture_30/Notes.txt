events --> action --> reaction

there are many types of action in js --> if we want to react on any action it will be done by events.

on any event trigger --> a reaction happen --> it triggers a function , and this function contains every details about that event.


in DOM we have to call a function means '()' ye lagana padta hai, but we donts have to write this in react.
