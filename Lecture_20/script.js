// methods --> function inside an object
// everything inside a JS is an object. like array, string.
// methods of array JS--->
   //  foreach, map, filter, reduce, sort, every, some.
   // all of this are higher order function accepts a call back function

// foreach function is a higher oeder function which accept a call back function which contain two argument item and index and foreach method does not return anything.

// map --> all same as foreach but it returns an array(it generates a new array for us). the returned array have same no. of element as the array on which the map method was applied. it is also a higher order function which accepts a call back function.



// filter --> array method accept a call back function need two argument item and index. it also returns a new array but the only catch is it only return truthy value so their is possibility that our previous array and returned array are not of the same length.

// reduce, sort, every, some --> MDN se padhna hai.
