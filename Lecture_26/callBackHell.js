/*
üëâ **What is Callback Hell (Pyramid of Doom)?**
- In the above code, we are nesting multiple callback functions inside each other.
- Each step requires the output of the previous step, leading to deep indentation and hard-to-read code.
- This structure is called **Callback Hell** (also known as the **Pyramid of Doom**) because the code grows horizontally and becomes difficult to maintain.

Example of Callback Hell:
step1(function(result1) {
    step2(result1, function(result2) {
        step3(result2, function(result3) {
            step4(result3);
        });
    });
});

‚ö†Ô∏è **Problems with Callback Hell:**
1. **Readability Issue:** Code becomes difficult to read and maintain.
2. **Error Handling:** Managing errors in deeply nested callbacks is complex.
3. **Scalability Issue:** As the number of steps increases, the nesting worsens.

‚úÖ **Advantages of Callbacks:**
1. Callbacks ensure **sequential execution**, which is essential in steps that depend on each other.

üí° **Solution to Callback Hell:**
- Instead of using callbacks, modern JavaScript offers better approaches:
  1. **Promises** ‚Äì Improve readability with `.then()` chaining.
  2. **Async/Await** ‚Äì Provides cleaner and more intuitive code flow.

In real-world applications, developers prefer **Promises** or **Async/Await** for better code structure and error handling.
