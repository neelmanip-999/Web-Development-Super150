// npm uninstall package-name --> it only removes the dependency from package.json

// rm -rf node_modules/package-name --> it removes the package from node_modules recursively 

// r for recursive and f for forcefully  

// if we have only package.json and no node_modules, then we can use npm uninstall package-name to remove the package from package.json

// if we want to download the package again on which our package.json is dependent we simply write npm install.
