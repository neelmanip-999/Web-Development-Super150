**Express.js** is a **minimal and flexible web application framework** for **Node.js**. It is used to build web applications and APIs easily and efficiently.

### üîß Key Features of Express.js:

1. **Middleware Support**: You can add multiple functions (middlewares) that process requests and responses.
2. **Routing**: It provides a powerful way to handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) and URL paths.
3. **Template Engines**: Supports rendering HTML using template engines like EJS, Pug, or Handlebars.
4. **Static File Serving**: Easily serve static files like images, CSS, and JS.
5. **RESTful API Support**: Ideal for building RESTful APIs.

### üõ† Simple Example:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

// Route for GET /
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, Express!');
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

### ‚öô How Express Works:

1. A user sends a request (e.g., visiting a webpage or calling an API).
2. Express checks for a matching route.
3. If found, it runs the appropriate callback function.
4. It sends a response back to the user.

### üåê Use Cases:

* Building **REST APIs**
* Creating **web applications** (both frontend + backend)
* Developing **microservices**
* Making **server-side rendering** apps
